            We work closely with a small roster of artists we believe in — not just for their music, but for their
            vision.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
            Each artist we manage receives a personalized approach that blends creative development, strategic planning,
            and long-term brand growth — both inside and outside of music.
